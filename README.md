# Agile

No single variant of Agile

### Origins
 - too many failed projects in 80s and 90s
	Too much up front analysis
	Restrictive change control
	Too much uncertainty

### Agile Manifesto
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value: 
 - Individuals and interactions 
	over processes and tools 
 - Working software over comprehensive documentation 
 - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
 - Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.



Changes become Opportunities to add value rather than obstacles to avoid

Agile is a mindset inspired by the agile manifesto

### Agile Principles
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of maximising the amount of work not done--is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organising teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.


### Retrospective
 - Set the stage 	
	 - Ensure everyone is comfortable speaking freely and remind the prime directive and the goal of the meeting
 - Gather the data
	 - On what happened during the sprint. There are a number of methods for this. We could use a Timeline or ‘Mood Graph’ and bring the sprints artefacts into the room.
 - Generate Insights
	 - Find out what it means. Find Patterns/ Important items/ Deepen understanding/ Find causes and effects
 - Decide what to do
 - Close the retrospective
